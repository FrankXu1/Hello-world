# Hello-world
This is the first programme!
That's a really good programme!


## Every branch should be concise and short-lived(few days)

## or represent a new feature or bug fixed

here is a master branch

and then i copy it to a new branch

then i correct or renew something on the branch

pull it after i finshed 

everyone check it and refine it

at last we can merge it to the master branch and delete that branch.
